\begin_layout Abstract
The removal of a top predator leading to an alternative stable state is
 a major area of ecological research.
 The movement into the alternative state is often caused when the ecosystem
 crosses a critical threshold.
 In many situations, it is the objective of managers to revert that ecosystem
 back to its historical state.
 This is accomplished by identifying a threshold for restoration.
 Yellowstone National Park is an iconic example of a system that shifted
 into an alternative stable state following the removal of wolves (
\shape italic
Canis lupus
\shape default
) in the early 1900s.
 Wolves were then reintroduced in 1995 with the goal of transitioning the
 ecosystem back to its original state.
 However, after almost 20 years of wolf presence in Yellowstone, the willow
 (
\shape italic
Salix
\shape default
 spp.) populations in Yellowstone's riparian areas have not recovered.
 There may be several reasons for this phenomena, but one problem may be
 that willow are not producing enough seeds.
 Qualitative observations have lead to a proposed willow height threshold
 for restoration of 200 cm (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "kay1991reduction"

\end_inset

).
 Here, we present a quantitative approach to estimate a willow height threshold
 for restoration with a Bayesian, zero-inflated Poisson regression.
 This model uses height and seed rain data from 21 randomly selected observation
al site across Yellowstone's Northern Range.
 We found that the threshold height for willow seed production is 85 cm
 (95% Bayesian credible interval = {27, 145}).
 This model gives managers a new perspective on estimating an observed ecologica
l threshold as well as rigorous basis for a willow height threshold for
 restoration.

A wealth of empirical data has substantiated the seminal theoretical prediction
 of

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 that populations, communities, and ecosystems can undergo abrupt, qualitative
 changes in response to biotic and environmental drivers (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "scheffer2009early"

\end_inset

).
 The point at which these changes occur is known as an ecological threshold,
 or in somewhat more contemporary language, a tipping point (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "dakos2013editorial"

\end_inset

).
 The movement of systems beyond ecological thresholds can result in alternative
 states, some of which resist reorganization to their original configuration
 over broad ranges of environmental conditions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "suding2004alternative"

\end_inset

).
 A much-studied threshold in ecology is population growth rate.
 When the instantaneous growth rate is less than 0, the population will
 decline, eventually to extinction.
 Qualitative shifts in population growth from increases to declines can
 ripple throughout ecosystems, causing changes in the structure of communities
 that stabilize alternative states (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "scheffer2001catastrophic"

\end_inset

).

Changes in landscape conditions on the northern range of Yellowstone National
 Park after the loss of wolves from the ecosystem and the subsequent release
 of the park's elk population from control by predators has been widely
 cited as a landmark example of an alternative state that developed following
 the reorganization of a terrestrial food web (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "ripple2012trophic,suding2004alternative,terborgh2001ecological,wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 A key feature of this state was the loss willows from riparian zones.
 The disappearance of willows was caused, at least in part, by the failure
 of young plants to establish, leading to an age-distribution where young
 plants were dramatically 
\lang english
underrepresented (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

)
\lang american
 and providing evidence for a negative population growth rate.
 The loss of willows from the system, in turn, led to self-reinforcing feedbacks
 to the major source of riparian disturbance, dam building by beaver (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "beschta2006river"

\end_inset

).
 This feedback occurred because beaver require willows for food and for
 dam building materials and willows require beaver to create habitat suitable
 for plant establishment.
 
\lang english
Seed production alone is not sufficient to assure willow reproduction --
 viable seeds must disperse to suitable sites on the landscape, which in
 the case of willow, are patches of bare, moist soil with shallow water
 tables, conditions that accompany disturbance of streams by beaver.
 Thus, seed production is a necessary if not a sufficient condition for
 willow reproduction, and hence, for restoration of riparian communities
 on the northern range.

\lang american
 The restoration of wolves to Yellowstone has raised the possibility that
 the system could reorganize to a configuration resembling the state that
 prevailed before wolves were extirpated.
 Demonstrating this reconfiguration depends on identifying ecological thresholds
 that can be measured on the landscape and that can be functionally related
 to key processes controlling state transition.
 W
\lang english
illow height has been widely used as an ecological threshold for ecosystem
 restoration in Yellowstone.
 Browsing by elk can eliminate reproduction by willows because browsed stems
 cannot produce catkins, and hence, produce no seeds (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "singer1994ungulate"

\end_inset

).
 Excessive browsing can reduce the stature of willows to the point that
 all stems are within reach of browsers, and as a result, production of
 catkins is virtually eliminated, a condition that was observed for decades
 following the loss of wolves from the system (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "bilyeu2007assessing"

\end_inset

).
 These observations gave rise to a widely used threshold for willow restoration,
 200 cm, the height at which the upper canopy of willows can reliably escape
 browsing.
 Although the 200 cm threshold is based on appealing, rough-hewn logic and
 is widely cited in papers on ecosystem restoration in Yellowstone (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "gage2005patterns,johnston2011relationships,bilyeu2008water,johnston2007elk,kay1991reduction"

\end_inset

), no one has demonstrated a quantitative, functional basis for a ecological
 threshold based on willow height.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we report investigations of the relationship between willow
 height and seed production on Yellowstone's northern range.
 We use this relationship to estimate a threshold at which seed production
 by willows increases above zero.
 We offer this threshold as an indicator of necessary conditions for restoration
 of the riparian zone following reintroduction of wolves.

Study Area
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observations of willow height and seed production were collected from 21
 randomly selected riparian sites on the northern range of Yellowstone National
 Park during June and July of 2010.
 These 21 observational sites were chosen from a sampling frame of stream
 sections that were either historically known to have beaver or were hypothesize
d to be a potential habitat for beaver based on gradient and stream order
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "marshall2013stream"

\end_inset

).
 Sites were selected from the frame using a spatially balanced random sampling
 algorithm (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "theobald2007using"

\end_inset

).
 Each observational site ran parallel to a stream for 100m and extended
 25m away from the stream margin.

\begin_layout Subsection
Observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Willow seeds were collected using seed traps constructed from 30 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 60 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 plywood boards covered with a layer of adhesive (Tree Tanglefoot
\begin_inset Formula $^{©}$
\end_inset

 Contech Inc.).
 Boards were staked into the ground using shelf brackets which were secured
 to the underside of each board.
 Two seed traps were placed 25 m from the margin of the 100 m river length
 transect line within 5 m of the river bank.
 These seed traps capture the ambient seed rain for the entire site.
 A third trap (measuring 30 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

) was placed on an area within the transect determined optimal for seedling
 establishment.
 Willow seeds at each site were counted then removed from all traps each
 week during the willow seed production season.
 Every willow within each site was measured from the center of the root
 base to the highest branch in centimeters.

\begin_layout Subsection
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We sought to estimate a threshold height for willow seed production 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\tilde{h}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The number of plants exceeding this threshold should effect the number
 of seeds produced that exceeded the threshold height required for seed
 production to occur, so we represent the data with the following equation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
x_{i} & = & \sum_{j=1}^{J_{i}}I_{\{h_{ij}\geq\tilde{h}\}}\\
\tilde{h} & \sim & \mathrm{Discrete\ Uniform}\left(0,300\right)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 indexes the individual plants, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 indexes site, and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\left\{ h_{ij}\ge\tilde{h}\right\} }$
\end_inset

 is an indicator variable = 1 when the condition within the 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\}$
\end_inset

 is true and 0 otherwise.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a count of plants equal to or above the estimated threshold height 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\tilde{h}\right)$
\end_inset

 at each site.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We needed to account for two sources of zeros in counts of seeds: zeros
 that occurred because there was no seed production at a site and zeros
 that occurred as a result of sampling error when the true state of average
 seed production was > 0.
 These considerations motivated us to use a zero inflated Poisson distribution
 to represent the relationship between seed production and the number of
 willows in a stand exceeding the threshold height:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
y_{ik} & \sim & \begin{cases}
0 & ,\: x_{i}=0\\
\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_{i}w_{ik}) & ,\: x_{i}>0
\end{cases}\label{eq:mixture model}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ik}$
\end_inset

 is the number of seeds per seed trap 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 at a site 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}$
\end_inset

 is an offset giving the area of each seed trap in 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:mixture model"

\end_inset

 simply says that when there are no plants at the site are above the threshold
 height 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i}=0)$
\end_inset

, then we will observe 0 seeds with probability 1.
 Otherwise, the number of seeds will be a Poisson distributed random variable
 with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We estimated the mean seed production (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i},$
\end_inset

 the intensity parameter of the Poisson) using
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{log}(\lambda_{i}) & = & \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\mathrm{log}(x_{i})+\gamma_{i}\\
\boldsymbol{\beta} & \sim & \mathrm{Multivariate\ Normal}\left(\boldsymbol{0},\sigma^{2}\boldsymbol{I}\right)\\
\gamma_{i} & \sim & \text{{Normal}}(0,1)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}=5$
\end_inset

.
 An extra set of random effect parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\gamma_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 were added to account for variation in seed detection between sites.
 Without these parameters, the posterior predictive p-value for the mean
 squared error was equal to .005, and with these parameters, the dispersion
 is improved slightly (p-value = 0.07).
 The full posterior expression is given here,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
\left[\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta},\tilde{h}\biggm\vert\bm{y},\bm{x}\right]\propto\prod_{i=1}^{21}\prod_{k=1}^{3}\left(I_{\{y_{i}=0\}}^{I_{\{x_{i}=0\}}}\mathrm{Poisson}\left(y_{ik}\biggm\vert\lambda_{i}w_{ik}\right)^{I_{\{x_{i}>0\}}}\right)\\
\times\mathrm{Multivariate\: Normal}\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}\biggm\vert\boldsymbol{0},\sigma^{2}\boldsymbol{I}\right)\mathrm{Discrete\ Uniform}\left(\tilde{h}\biggm\vert0,300\right)\mathrm{Normal}\left(\gamma_{i}\big|0,1\right)
\end{multline}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Parameter Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are twenty-four unobserved quantities in this model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h},\beta_{0},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We chose priors based on simulated data that closely imitated the behavior
 of the observed data.
 The threshold height parameter has a discrete uniform prior because the
 willow heights were measured to the nearest centimeter resulting in a discrete
 height dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marginal posterior distributions of states, parameters, and model predictions
 were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the R computing
 environment (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "rdevelopment2011team"

\end_inset

).
 Parameters were estimated using a random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
 with discrete uniform and normal proposal distributions tuned to provide
 an acceptance rate of between 20% and 60% (See Appendix for full conditional
 distributions).
 Three chains were chosen for each estimated quantity.
 Convergence was assured by inspection of trace plots with varying initial
 conditions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "brooks1998general"

\end_inset

).
 All code and trace plots for this model can be found in the appendix.

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-marginal-posterior"

\end_inset

, we show the marginal posterior distributions of the model parameters,
 and in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:The-means-and"

\end_inset

 we report the means and 95% credible intervals of each parameter.
 The parameters converged after 20,000 iterations of the MCMC Sampler as
 indicated by visual inspection of the trace plots for all parameters with
 a 4,000 iteration burn-in.
 It is also notable that the model has estimated the lower bound of the
 seed producing plots as the threshold for seed production (Figure

Ecological thresholds have important implications for ecosystem management
 and ecological theory.
 Yellowstone National Park has been a premier example of a major shift over
 a critical threshold from one alternative stable state to another following
 the extirpation of a top predator (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 The reintroduction of the wolf reduced elk populations by 70% supposedly
 paving the way for riparian willow recovery (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "ripple2012trophic"

\end_inset

).
 However, alternative evidence suggests that wolves are not the only species
 needed to restore the area's original willow populations.
 Beaver depend on willow for nourishment and protection, so following the
 extreme decrease in the willow population beavers vacated Yellowstone.
 Without beaver, willows have been unable to reestablish to historic levels.
 This self-reinforcing feedback has caused researchers to conclude that
 Yellowstone has shifted to an elk grassland stable stage (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 We know that beavers are critical in the process of shifting Yellowstone's
 ecosystem back to its historical stable state, but we do not know when
 willows will be able to produce seeds in order to begin the reestablishment
 process.
 With this model and randomly collected data, we estimate that the threshold
 height for willow seed production on Yellowstone's Northern Range has an
 average of 85 cm.
 This is well below the previous estimate of by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kay1991reduction"

\end_inset

 who believed that the threshold height for seed production was around 200cm.
 However, we can see in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hists"

\end_inset

 that our model has estimated the lower bound of the heights of seed producing
 sites and that the non seed producing sites have very few willows at or
 above this threshold height.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The increase of riparian willow is the key to the restoration of Yellowstone,
 but it cannot occur until more willows are producing seeds.
 In this study the heights of over 2200 willow were measured and 77% of
 willow were above the threshold height of 85 cm (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hists"

\end_inset

).
 In spite of this high percentage, only 14 of the 21 sites had more than
 6 tall willows present.
 All but one site had several up and coming willows between 25 - 50 cm.
 This suggests that some sites are on the verge of recovery while other
 sites still lag behind.
 Willows will continue to grow because herbivore populations have decreased,
 but that there do not yet seem to be enough tall plants to allow the willow
 communities to expand to historic levels at all sites.
 A tall and populated willow community that facilitates seedling recruitment
 will allow for willow recovery, but returning to this state may be impossible
 without beaver to increase water availability and exposed soil for seedling
 establishment in the riparian corridors.

Threshold Modeling: Generalizations for Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have provided a Bayesian structure that can allow managers to input their
 own knowledge through data, informed priors, and increased number of covariates
 in a intuitive and rigorous way to determine a threshold value in their
 own system and to quantify the uncertainty associated with those estimates.
 This gives the manager and the researcher a Bayesian alternative to the
 piecewise regression described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "toms2003piecewise"

\end_inset

.
 Our use of an indicator variable in the process model signals to the flexibilit
y of this methodology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Change-point models are becoming more critical as our world continues to
 change.
 Shifts in ecosystems are occurring rapidly.
 It will be important for managers to understand ecological thresholds and
 have a quantitative basis for estimating their values (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "estes2011trophic"

\end_inset

).
 Thresholds often form the basis for management action plans as well as
 the interpretation of the type of stable state an ecosystem is realizing
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "groffman2006ecological"

\end_inset

).
 Mistakes in these estimations could lead to mismanagement which could lead
 to further ecological harm.
 In Yellowstone National Park, managers need to know these types of critical
 details for willow reestablishment in order to return the ecosystem to
 its historical stable state.
 They have taken courageous steps to reduce the herbivore population by
 reintroducing wolves, and now they seek to know more about what needs to
 happen to reconstruct their riparian corridors.
 Knowing an ecological threshold and the inherent uncertainty is one step
 in a very complicated problem that can help managers and researchers further
 understand the transition from one stable state to another.
