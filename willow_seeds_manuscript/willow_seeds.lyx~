Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The removal of a top predator leading to an alternative stable state is
 a major area of ecological research.
 The movement into the alternative state is often caused when the ecosystem
 crosses a critical threshold.
 In many situations, it is the objective of managers to revert that ecosystem
 back to its historical state.
 This is accomplished by identifying a threshold for restoration.
 Yellowstone National Park is an iconic example of a system that shifted
 into an alternative stable state following the removal of wolves (
\shape italic
Canis lupus
\shape default
) in the early 1900s.
 Wolves were then reintroduced in 1995 with the goal of transitioning the
 ecosystem back to its original state.
 However, after almost 20 years of wolf presence in Yellowstone, the willow
 (
\shape italic
Salix
\shape default
) populations in Yellowstone's riparian areas have not recovered.
 There may be several reasons for this phenomena, but one problem may be
 that willow are not producing enough seeds.
 A willow height threshold for restoration has been proposed for Yellowstone
 National Park's willow (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "kay1991reduction"

\end_inset

).
 Here, we present a Bayesian, zero-inflated Poisson regression which uses
 height and seed rain data from 21 randomly selected observational site
 across Yellowstone's Northern Range to estimate a willow height threshold
 for restoration.
 We found that the threshold height for willow seed production is very close
 to 200 cm from stem base to tallest stem.
 This model gives managers a new perspective on estimating ecological thresholds
 as well as rigorous basis for a willow height threshold for restoration.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An ecological threshold can be an important management tool when used to
 determine whether or not an ecosystem is moving into an alternative stable
 state (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "groffman2006ecological"

\end_inset

).
 It is well known that large populations of mammalian herbivores can cause
 a severe decline in riparian vegetation which may force a system beyond
 a threshold and into an alternative state (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "singer1994ungulate,wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 If willows (
\shape italic
Salix
\shape default
) are inhibited from recruitment or if they simply do not survive, their
 population can decrease substantially, even beyond the point of reestablishment
 to their original stable state.
 Willows will not be able to recruit new plants if either they have become
 too damaged to produce catkins or the ground surrounding the seed producing
 willows is not fit for seedling establishment (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "gage2005patterns"

\end_inset

).
 Willows become viable when they begin producing seeds; therefore, it is
 useful to determine a threshold for seed production to know when soil for
 establishment can also be a factor in new willow growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Willow reestablishment has become a forward issue on the Northern Range
 in Yellowstone National Park.
 Wolves (
\shape italic
Canis lupus
\shape default
) were not present in Yellowstone from the early 1900s until their reintroductio
n in 1995.
 This allowed elk populations to grow exponentially and nearly wipe out
 riparian willow communities.
 The reintroduction of wolves has significantly reduced elk herbivory of
 riparian willows, but the keystone species, beaver, have not recovered.
 Beaver and willow depend on each other for growth and recruitment.
 Beaver eat willow and also use willow to build dams which raises the water
 table to an ideal level for willow growth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "bilyeu2008water"

\end_inset

).
 Eventually, the beaver dam will break, draining a water pool and leaving
 exposed soil which is essential for willow seedling establishment (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "gage2005patterns"

\end_inset

).
 Without beaver activity there is minimal soil for willow reestablishment
 along the riparian corridors.
 Willows also play an important role in the structure of the stream banks,
 which can become incised and further decrease the area of feasible willow
 habitat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been shown that due to extirpation of wolves, heavy elk browsing,
 and a decreased beaver population a new stable state has arisen known as
 the elk grass state (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 Tall willows that were ubiquitous in the early 1900s are now rare and lowered
 water tables have made it difficult for them to return to a tall willow
 community.
 This new stable state may have also prevented willows from reestablishing
 because there may be a lack of seed production.
 Data from our observational study suggests that most willow on Yellowstone's
 Northern Range are between 50cm and 200cm (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:A-histogram-of"

\end_inset

).
 This suggests that their is a missing older age class among willows that
 are still recovering from overabundant herbivore populations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if beaver populations were reintroduced to Yellowstone's Northern Range
 and began to thrive, willow reestablishment would still depend on seed
 production.
 It has been hypothesized that willows will not produce seeds until they
 reach a threshold height (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "kay1991reduction"

\end_inset

) and was also suggested in our initial analysis (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Raw-data-collected"

\end_inset

), but there has yet to be any objective basis for that claim.
 Here, we provide a model that uses data collected from 21 randomly selected
 riparian sites across Yellowstone's Northern Range to rigorously estimate
 the threshold height for willow reestablishment.
 This model also has broader implications for restoration biology because
 it can be used by any manager who seeks to estimate a threshold for recovery
 with or without previous information.

Study Area
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data used in this analysis were collected from 21 randomly selected riparian
 areas in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park in June and July
 of 2010.
 These 21 observational sites originated from a database of stream sections
 that were either historically known to have beaver or were hypothesized
 to be a potential habitat for beaver based on gradient and stream order
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "marshall2013stream"

\end_inset

).
 The sites were selected using a spatially balanced random sampling algorithm
 (RRQRR).
 Each observational site was measured 100m by river length and extended
 25m away from the river.

Data Collection

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Seed Traps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Willow seeds were collected using seed traps made with an adhesive called
 Tree Tanglefoot
\begin_inset Formula $^{©}$
\end_inset

 on plywood boards which were staked into the ground using shelf brackets.
 Two seed traps (measuring 30 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 60 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

) were placed 25 m from the margin of the 100 m river length transect line
 within 5 m of the river bank.
 These seed traps capture the ambient seed rain for the entire site.
 A third trap (measuring 30 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

) was placed on an area within the transect determined optimal for seedling
 establishment.
 Willow seeds at each site were counted then removed from all traps each
 week during the willow seed production season.
 We will use the sum of the seeds counted from each site in our model.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Overview of Modeling Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We constructed a Bayesian, zero inflated Poisson model to account for process
 variance and observation error in our analysis of the effect of willow
 height on seed production.
 We estimated the marginal posterior distributions of parameters, specifically,
 the threshold height for willow seed production.
 A comprehensive representation of the model follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\boldsymbol{z},p,\boldsymbol{\beta}\big|\boldsymbol{y}) & \propto & P(\boldsymbol{y}\big|\boldsymbol{\lambda})^{\boldsymbol{z}}P(y=0)^{\boldsymbol{z}-1}P(\boldsymbol{z}\big|p)P(p,\boldsymbol{\beta})\label{eq:overview}\\
\boldsymbol{\lambda} & = & \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\label{eq:lamtocovars}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{z}$
\end_inset

 represents our prediction of the true state of willow seed count that we
 observed in vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{y}$
\end_inset

 where either 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

.
 The true state is derived from a process model when 
\begin_inset Formula $y>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

.
 Otherwise when 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 with probability 1.
 The process model is formed by a deterministic regression shown in equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lamtocovars"

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{X}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix of covariates multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\beta}$
\end_inset

 a vector of parameters.
 We estimate these parameters in a parameter model.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:overview"

\end_inset

 will serve as a guide to our methods section.
 First we will outline the models of the data, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\boldsymbol{y}\big|\boldsymbol{\lambda})^{\boldsymbol{z}}P(y=0)^{\boldsymbol{z}-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we will describe models of the process 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\boldsymbol{z}\big|p)$
\end_inset

 that determines the true state of willow seed production.
 Next, we will explain our choice of the parameter models, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(p,\boldsymbol{\beta})$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we will assemble the full model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This three sub-model structure allows us to represent uncertainty associated
 with data collection in the data model, account for the underlying mechanisms
 from which the data are drawn in the process model, and define prior distributi
ons of the parameters in the parameter model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose a zero-inflated Poisson regression model because some sites 
\begin_inset Formula $(i)$
\end_inset

 had no seeds.
 Thus, our data model is represented below:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
y_{i} & \sim & \begin{cases}
0 & ,\: x_{i}=0\\
\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_{i}) & ,\: x_{i}>0
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is our prediction of the true state and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the seed count data for site 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Process Model
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Process-Model"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We seek to estimate a threshold height for willow seed recruitment, but
 we also recognize that the number of willows in a plot among other things
 should effect seed production.
 To estimate the effect of willow height and numbers of willow in the plot
 on seed recruitment, we created an indicator variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 to count the number of willows in each plot above a threshold height 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\tilde{h}\right)$
\end_inset

 with an interaction effect with total willow height 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ij}$
\end_inset

 for the site such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{J_{i}}1_{\{h_{ij}\geq\tilde{h}\}}h_{ij}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is an index for the individual willow.
 Then, to compute the intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda_{i})$
\end_inset

, we used the following regression model:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\mathrm{log}(x_{i})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 was only calculated when 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}>0$
\end_inset

 because as stated in the previous section if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 with probability 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Parameter Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three parameters in this model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h},\beta_{0},$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Previous evidence suggests that the threshold height for willow seed recruitmen
t is 200 cm (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "kay1991reduction"

\end_inset

), so we assigned an informative prior to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h}$
\end_inset

 by moment matching a gamma distribution with mean = 200 and variance =
 50.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{h}\sim\mathrm{gamma}(4,.02)
\]

\end_inset

We gave the coefficients in our regression model vague priors with mean
 = 0 and variance = 50.
 We assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 were independently and identically distributed.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{\beta}\sim N(\boldsymbol{\mu_{\beta}},\sigma^{2}I)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Posterior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full posterior and joint distributions are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
\left[\boldsymbol{\beta},\tilde{h}\biggm\vert y_{i}\right]\propto\underset{i}{\prod}\left(1_{\{y_{i}=0\}}^{1_{\{x_{i}=0\}}}\mathrm{Poisson}\left(y_{i}\biggm\vert\lambda_{i}\right)^{1_{\{x_{i}>0\}}}\right)\\
\times\mathrm{Multivariate\: Normal}\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}\biggm\vert0,50\right)\mathrm{Gamma}\left(\tilde{h}\biggm\vert2,0.04\right)
\end{multline}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marginal posterior distributions of states, parameters, and model predictions
 were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the R computing
 environment (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "rdevelopment2011team"

\end_inset

).
 Parameters were estimated using a random walk metropolis-hastings algorithm
 with normal proposal distributions.
 Three chains were chosen for each estimated quantity.
 Initial values of chains were each chosen to vary 20% in either direction
 relative to posterior distributions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "brooks1998general"

\end_inset

).
 Convergence was assured by inspection of trace plots and by the diagnostics
 of Gelman and Rubin (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "gelman1992inference"

\end_inset

).
 All code for this model can be found in the supplementary materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we describe the results of our MCMC output.
 We accumulated 100,000 samples from each chain and discarded 20,000 iterations
 as the burn-in to ensure convergence of parameter chains.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-marginal-posterior"

\end_inset

, we show the marginal posterior distributions of the model parameters,
 and in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:The-means-and"

\end_inset

 we report the means and 95% credible intervals of each parameter.
 The parameters converged after 100,000 iterations of the MCMC Sampler as
 indicated by the Gelman Diagnostics of 1.00 for all parameters with a 20,000
 iteration burn-in.

The Willow Height Threshold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological thresholds have important implications for ecosystem management
 and ecological theory.
 Yellowstone National Park has been a premier example of a major shift over
 a critical threshold from one alternative stable state to another following
 the extirpation of a top predator (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 The reintroduction of the wolf reduced elk populations by 70% supposedly
 paving the way for riparian willow recovery (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "ripple2012trophic"

\end_inset

).
 However, alternative evidence suggests that wolves are not the only species
 needed to restore the area's original willow populations.
 Beaver depend on willow for nourishment and protection, so following the
 extreme decrease in the willow population beavers vacated Yellowstone.
 Now without beaver, willows have been unable to reestablish because beaver
 dams raise the water table which is essential for willow growth, and when
 the dams break, they also create establishment soil for seedlings.
 This positive feedback has caused researchers to conclude that Yellowstone
 has shifted to an elk grassland stable stage (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 We know that beavers are critical in the process of shifting Yellowstone's
 ecosystem back to its historical stable state, but we do not know when
 willows will be able to produce seeds in order to begin the reestablishment
 process.
 With this model and randomly collected data, we proved that the threshold
 height for willow seed production on Yellowstone's Northern Range is very
 close to 200 cm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The increase of riparian willow is the key to the restoration of Yellowstone,
 but it cannot occur until more willows are producing seeds.
 In this study the heights of over 2200 willow were measured and only 16%
 of willow were above the threshold height of 200 cm (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hists"

\end_inset

).
 In spite of this low percentage, 13 of the 21 sites had tall willows present
 and most sites had several up and coming willows between 50 - 200 cm.
 We suggest that willows are beginning to produce seeds and that they will
 continue to grow because herbivore populations have decreased.
 Although there are tall willows in more than half of the sites, there do
 not yet seem to be enough tall plants to allow the willow communities to
 expand to historic levels.
 The seeds produced at a site are not simply a function of the number of
 tall plants.
 We are also interested in the effect of the sheer number of willows present.
 This is why our indicator variable in the process model includes an interaction
 factor between number of tall willows and cumulative willow height at the
 site 
\begin_inset Formula $(h_{ij})$
\end_inset

.
 The estimated value of our slope coefficient in our regression model suggests
 that this interaction effect is very important 
\begin_inset Formula $(\beta_{1}=9.48)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, a tall and large willow community that facilitates seedling recruitment
 will allow for willow recovery, but returning to this state may be impossible
 without more water and exposed soil for seedling establishment in the riparian
 corridors.

Threshold Modeling: Generalizations for Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have provided a Bayesian structure that can allow managers to input their
 own knowledge through data, informed priors, and increased number of covariates
 in a intuitive and rigorous way to determine a threshold value in their
 own system and to quantify the uncertainty associated with those estimates.
 This gives the manager and the researcher a Bayesian alternative to the
 piecewise regression described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "toms2003piecewise"

\end_inset

.
 Our use of an indicator variable in the process model signals to the flexibilit
y of this methodology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These types of models are becoming more critical as our world continues
 to change.
 Shifts in ecosystems are occurring rapidly.
 It will be important for managers to understand ecological thresholds and
 have a quantitative basis for estimating their values.
 Thresholds often form the basis for management action plans as well as
 interpreting the type of stable state an ecosystem is realizing.
 Mistakes in these estimations could lead to mismanagement which could lead
 to further ecological harm.
 In Yellowstone National Park, managers need to know these types of critical
 details for willow reestablishment in order to return the ecosystem to
 its historical stable state.
 They have taken courageous steps to reduce the herbivore population by
 reintroducing wolves, and now they seek to know more about what needs to
 happen to reconstruct their riparian corridors.
 Knowing an ecological threshold and the inherent uncertainty is one step
 in a very complicated problem that can help managers and researchers further
 understand the transition from one stable state to another.

This is a plot of the frequency of the willow heights measured in this study.
 The black curve is the frequency of willow heights for sites that did not
 produce seeds.
 The green curve is the frequency of willow heights for the sits that did
 produce seeds.
 The black dotted line is the overall average willow height, and the blue
 dotted line is the estimated height threshold

 The majority of willows (84%) are below the estimated threshold height
 for seed production (200cm).
