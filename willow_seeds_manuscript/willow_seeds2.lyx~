\begin_layout Abstract
The removal of a top predator leading to an alternative stable state is
 a major area of ecological research.
 The movement into the alternative state is often caused when the ecosystem
 crosses a critical threshold.
 In many situations, it is the objective of managers to revert that ecosystem
 back to its historical state.
 This is accomplished by identifying a threshold for restoration.
 Yellowstone National Park is an iconic example of a system that shifted
 into an alternative stable state following the removal of wolves (
\shape italic
Canis lupus
\shape default
) in the early 1900s.
 Wolves were then reintroduced in 1995 with the goal of transitioning the
 ecosystem back to its original state.
 However, after almost 20 years of wolf presence in Yellowstone, the willow
 (
\shape italic
Salix
\shape default
) populations in Yellowstone's riparian areas have not recovered.
 There may be several reasons for this phenomena, but one problem may be
 that willow are not producing enough seeds.
 A willow height threshold for restoration has been proposed for Yellowstone
 National Park's willow (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "kay1991reduction"

\end_inset

).
 Here, we present a Bayesian, zero-inflated Poisson regression which uses
 height and seed rain data from 21 randomly selected observational site
 across Yellowstone's Northern Range to estimate a willow height threshold
 for restoration.
 We found that the threshold height for willow seed production is very close
 to 200 cm from stem base to tallest stem.
 This model gives managers a new perspective on estimating ecological thresholds
 as well as rigorous basis for a willow height threshold for restoration.

Changes in landscape conditions on the northern range of Yellowstone National
 Park after the loss of wolves from the ecosystem and the subsequent release
 of the park's elk population from control by predators has been widely
 cited as an landmark example of an alternative state that developed following
 the reorganization of a terrestrial food web .
 A key feature of this state was the loss willows from riparian zones.
 The disappearance of willows was caused, at least in part, by the failure
 of young plants to establish, leading to an age-distribution where young
 plants were dramatically 
\lang english
underrepresented (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

)
\lang american
 and providing evidence for a negative population growth rate.
 The loss of willows from the system, in turn, led to self-reinforcing feedbacks
 to the major source of riparian disturbance, dam building by beaver.
 This feedback occurred because beaver require willows for food and for
 dam building materials and willows require beaver to create habitat suitable
 for plant establishment.
 
\lang english
Seed production alone is not sufficient to assure willow reproduction --
 viable seeds must disperse to suitable sites on the landscape, which in
 the case of willow, are patches of bare, moist soil with shallow water
 tables, conditions that accompany disturbance of streams by beaver.
 Thus, seed production is a necessary if not a sufficient condition for
 willow reproduction and, hence, for restoration of riparian communities
 on the northern range.
\lang american
The restoration of wolves to Yellowstone has raised the possibility that
 the system could reorganize to a configuration resembling the state that
 prevailed before wolves were extirpated.
 Demonstrating this reconfiguration depends on identifying ecological thresholds
 that can be measured on the landscape and that can be functionally related
 to key processes controlling state transition.
 W
\lang english
illow height has been widely used as an ecological threshold for ecosystem
 restoration in Yellowstone.
 Browsing by elk can eliminate reproduction by willows because browsed stems
 cannot produce catkins, and hence, produce no seeds.
 Excessive browsing can reduce the stature of willows to the point that
 all stems are within reach of browsers, and as a result, production of
 catkins is virtually eliminated, a condition that was observed for decades
 following the loss of wolves from the system ( ).
 These observations gave rise to a widely used threshold for willow restoration,
 200 cm, the height at which the upper canopy of willows can reliably escape
 browsing.
 Although the 200 cm threshold is based on appealing, rough-hewn logic and
 is widely cited in papers on ecosystem restoration in Yellowstone ( ),
 no one has demonstrated a quantitative, functional basis for a ecological
 threshold based on willow height.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we report investigations of the relationship between willow
 height and seed production on Yellowstone's northern range.
 We use this relationship to estimate a threshold at which seed production
 by willows increases above zero.
 We offer this threshold an indicator of necessary conditions for restoration
 of the riparian zone following reintroduction of wolves.

\begin_layout Standard
Observations of willow height and seed production were collected from 21
 randomly selected riparian sites on the northern range of Yellowstone National
 Park during June and July of 2010.
 These 21 observational sites were chosen from a sampling frame of stream
 sections that were either historically known to have beaver or were hypothesize
d to be a potential habitat for beaver based on gradient and stream order
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "marshall2013stream"

\end_inset

).
 Sites were selected from the frame using a spatially balanced random sampling
 algorithm (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "theobald2007using"

).
 Each observational site ran parallel to a stream for 100m and extended
 25m away from the stream margin.

Willow seeds were collected using seed traps constructed from 30 cm

\end_inset

 plywood boards covered with a layer of adhesive (Tree Tanglefoot

 Boards were staked into the ground using shelf brackets.
 Two seed traps were placed 25 m from the margin of the 100 m river length
 transect line within 5 m of the river bank.
 These seed traps capture the ambient seed rain for the entire site.
 A third trap (measuring 30 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

) was placed on an area within the transect determined optimal for seedling
 establishment.
 Willow seeds at each site were counted then removed from all traps each
 week during the willow seed production season.
 Every willow within each site was measured from the center of the root
 base to the highest branch in centimeters.

\begin_layout Subsection
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We sought to estimate a threshold height for willow seed production 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\tilde{h}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The number of plants exceeding this threshold should effect the number
 of seeds produced that exceeded the threshold height required for seed
 production to occur, so we represent the data with the following equation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
x_{i} & = & \sum_{i=1}^{J_{i}}I_{\{h_{ij}\geq\tilde{h}\}}\\
\tilde{h} & \sim & \mathrm{Discrete\ Uniform}\left(0,400\right)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 indexes the individual plants, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 indexes site, and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\left\{ h_{ij}\ge\tilde{h}\right\} }$
\end_inset

 is an indicator variable = 1 when the condition within the 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\}$
\end_inset

 is true and 0 otherwise.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a count of plants above the estimated threshold height 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\tilde{h}\right)$
\end_inset

 at each site.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We needed to account for two sources of zeros in counts of seeds: zeros
 that occurred because there was no seed production at a site and zeros
 that occurred as a result of sampling error when the true state of average
 seed production was > 0.
 These considerations motivated us to use a zero inflated Poisson distribution
 to represent the relationship between seed production and the number of
 willows in a stand exceeding the threshold height:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
y_{ik} & \sim & \begin{cases}
0 & ,\: x_{i}=0\\
\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_{i}w_{ik}) & ,\: x_{i}>0
\end{cases}\label{eq:mixture model}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ik}$
\end_inset

 is the number of seeds per seed trap 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}$
\end_inset

 at a site 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}$
\end_inset

 is an offset giving the area of each seed trap in 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:mixture model"

\end_inset

 simply says that when there are no plants at the site are above the threshold
 height 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i}=0)$
\end_inset

, then we will observe 0 seeds with probability 1.
 Otherwise, the number of seeds will be a Poisson distributed random variable
 with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We estimated the mean seed production (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i},$
\end_inset

 the intensity parameter of the Poisson) using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{log}(\lambda_{i}) & = & \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\mathrm{log}(x_{i})+\gamma_{i}\\
\gamma_{i} & \sim & \text{{normal}}(0,.0001)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

An extra set of parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 were added because the Poisson distribution was underdispersed with a mean
 squared error posterior predictive p-value equal to .05.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full posterior and joint distributions are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
\left[\boldsymbol{\beta},\tilde{h}\biggm\vert\bm{y},\bm{x}\right]\propto\prod_{i=1}^{21}\prod_{k=1}^{3}\left(I_{\{y_{i}=0\}}^{I_{\{x_{i}=0\}}}\mathrm{Poisson}\left(y_{ik}\biggm\vert\lambda_{i}w_{ik}\right)^{I_{\{x_{i}>0\}}}\right)\\
\times\mathrm{Multivariate\: Normal}\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}\biggm\vert0,1\right)\mathrm{Discrete\ Uniform}\left(\tilde{h}\biggm\vert0,400\right)\mathrm{Normal}\left(\gamma_{i}\big|0,.0001\right)

Marginal posterior distributions of states, parameters, and model predictions
 were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the R computing
 environment (

).
 Parameters were estimated using a random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
 with discrete uniform and normal proposal distribution tuned to provide
 an acceptance rate of between 20% and 60%.
 Three chains were chosen for each estimated quantity.
 Initial values of chains were each chosen to vary 20% in either direction
 relative to posterior distributions (

 Convergence was assured by inspection of trace plots and by the diagnostics

The Willow Height Threshold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological thresholds have important implications for ecosystem management
 and ecological theory.
 Yellowstone National Park has been a premier example of a major shift over
 a critical threshold from one alternative stable state to another following
 the extirpation of a top predator (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 The reintroduction of the wolf reduced elk populations by 70% supposedly
 paving the way for riparian willow recovery (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "ripple2012trophic"

\end_inset

).
 However, alternative evidence suggests that wolves are not the only species
 needed to restore the area's original willow populations.
 Beaver depend on willow for nourishment and protection, so following the
 extreme decrease in the willow population beavers vacated Yellowstone.
 Now without beaver, willows have been unable to reestablish because beaver
 dams raise the water table which is essential for willow growth, and when
 the dams break, they also create establishment soil for seedlings.
 This positive feedback has caused researchers to conclude that Yellowstone
 has shifted to an elk grassland stable stage (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "wolf2007hydrologic"

\end_inset

).
 We know that beavers are critical in the process of shifting Yellowstone's
 ecosystem back to its historical stable state, but we do not know when
 willows will be able to produce seeds in order to begin the reestablishment
 process.
 With this model and randomly collected data, we proved that the threshold
 height for willow seed production on Yellowstone's Northern Range is very
 close to 200 cm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The increase of riparian willow is the key to the restoration of Yellowstone,
 but it cannot occur until more willows are producing seeds.
 In this study the heights of over 2200 willow were measured and only 16%
 of willow were above the threshold height of 200 cm (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:hists"

\end_inset

).
 In spite of this low percentage, 13 of the 21 sites had tall willows present
 and most sites had several up and coming willows between 50 - 200 cm.
 We suggest that willows are beginning to produce seeds and that they will
 continue to grow because herbivore populations have decreased.
 Although there are tall willows in more than half of the sites, there do
 not yet seem to be enough tall plants to allow the willow communities to
 expand to historic levels.
 The seeds produced at a site are not simply a function of the number of
 tall plants.
 We are also interested in the effect of the sheer number of willows present.
 This is why our indicator variable in the process model includes an interaction
 factor between number of tall willows and cumulative willow height at the
 site 
\begin_inset Formula $(h_{ij})$
\end_inset

.
 The estimated value of our slope coefficient in our regression model suggests
 that this interaction effect is very important 
\begin_inset Formula $(\beta_{1}=9.48)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, a tall and large willow community that facilitates seedling recruitment
 will allow for willow recovery, but returning to this state may be impossible
 without more water and exposed soil for seedling establishment in the riparian
 corridors.

Threshold Modeling: Generalizations for Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have provided a Bayesian structure that can allow managers to input their
 own knowledge through data, informed priors, and increased number of covariates
 in a intuitive and rigorous way to determine a threshold value in their
 own system and to quantify the uncertainty associated with those estimates.
 This gives the manager and the researcher a Bayesian alternative to the
 piecewise regression described in

.
 Our use of an indicator variable in the process model signals to the flexibilit
y of this methodology.

These types of models are becoming more critical as our world continues
 to change.
 Shifts in ecosystems are occurring rapidly.
 It will be important for managers to understand ecological thresholds and
 have a quantitative basis for estimating their values.
 Thresholds often form the basis for management action plans as well as
 interpreting the type of stable state an ecosystem is realizing.
 Mistakes in these estimations could lead to mismanagement which could lead
 to further ecological harm.
 In Yellowstone National Park, managers need to know these types of critical
 details for willow reestablishment in order to return the ecosystem to
 its historical stable state.
 They have taken courageous steps to reduce the herbivore population by
 reintroducing wolves, and now they seek to know more about what needs to
 happen to reconstruct their riparian corridors.
 Knowing an ecological threshold and the inherent uncertainty is one step
 in a very complicated problem that can help managers and researchers further
 understand the transition from one stable state to another.

This is a plot of the frequency of the willow heights measured in this study.
 The black curve is the frequency of willow heights for sites that did not
 produce seeds.
 The green curve is the frequency of willow heights for the sits that did
 produce seeds.
 The black dotted line is the overall average willow height, and the blue
 dotted line is the estimated height threshold

 The majority of willows (84%) are below the estimated threshold height
 for seed production (200cm).
